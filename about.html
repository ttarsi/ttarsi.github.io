      Hey, I'm Tyler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I graduated in 2019, I've lived in San Francisco. I'm currently 
      researching and building in decentralized finance, primarily in the Ethereum ecosystem. I am
      also interested in the evolution of blockchains more broadly. Formerly, I worked at a machine learning
      startup as an ML engineer and product lead, building ML applications for financial markets, 
      trading systems, and energy markets. At Harvard, I studied applied mathematics with a focus 
      in economics and computer science, in addition to teaching several mathematics undergrad courses. 
      I was also captain of the wrestling team.

      I am interested in defi, deep learning, game theory, cryptoeconomics, 
      category theory, political philosophy, and more. I recently started writing down some of my 
      thoughts at <a href="https://tarsi.substack.com">tarsi.substack.com</a>.
